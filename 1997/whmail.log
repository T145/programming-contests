Mr. President:
	The situation with the lady in Roby is quickly deteriorating.
I advise we use an Apache loaded with napalm to flush the crazy
woman out. If it kills her, it serves her right for that Vaseline
trick. Dead or alive, at least it will be over. If I don’t hear
from you within the next hour, I’ll send for the chopper.
